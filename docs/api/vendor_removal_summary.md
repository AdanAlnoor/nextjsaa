# Vendor Reference Removal Summary

All references to "vendor" have been removed from the codebase and replaced with "supplier". This document summarizes the changes made.

## Files Modified

### 1. TypeScript Code

**src/lib/services/purchase-order-service.ts**
- Updated comment to remove reference to "vendor"
- Modified the `transformPurchaseOrders` function to only use "supplier" instead of checking for both "vendor" and "supplier"
- Changed fallback handling to only use "Unknown Supplier" when supplier is missing

### 2. SQL Files

**fix_purchase_order_display.sql**
- Changed `supplier as "vendor"` to just `supplier` in the SELECT statement

**fix_purchase_orders.sql**
- Updated column name from "vendor" to "supplier" in the CREATE TABLE statement
- Updated column name in the SELECT query
- Updated INSERT statement to use "supplier" instead of "vendor"

### 3. New SQL Files

**remove_vendor_references.sql**
- Created a new SQL script that:
  - Drops the backward compatibility view `purchase_orders_with_vendor`
  - Checks if the "vendor" column exists in the purchase_orders table
  - If both "vendor" and "supplier" columns exist, merges data and drops the "vendor" column
  - If only "vendor" column exists, renames it to "supplier"
  - Verifies the changes by checking if "supplier" column exists and "vendor" column is gone

## Next Steps

To complete the removal of all "vendor" references in your database, you should:

1. Execute the `remove_vendor_references.sql` script in your database environment (Supabase SQL editor or other database tool)

2. Update any client-side code that might still be expecting "vendor" in API responses

3. Test the application to make sure all purchase order functionality works correctly with "supplier" instead of "vendor"

## Note on SQL Scripts

Several SQL migration files contain references to "vendor" but were kept as-is since they represent historical migrations. These include:

- check_column_names.sql
- vendor_to_supplier_migration.sql
- fix_all_purchase_order_issues.sql

If you want to completely remove all traces of "vendor", you could also delete these migration files as they are no longer needed.
