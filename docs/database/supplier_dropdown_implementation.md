# Supplier Dropdown Implementation

This document explains the implementation of the supplier dropdown where users can add new suppliers and delete existing ones.

## Database Changes

1. Created a new `suppliers` table in the database:
   - `id`: UUID primary key
   - `name`: VARCHAR(255), unique, not null
   - `description`: TEXT, nullable
   - Additional fields for contact information and address

2. Created appropriate row-level security (RLS) policies to allow authenticated users to view, add, update, and delete suppliers.

3. Added a `supplier_id` column to the `purchase_orders` table as a foreign key reference to the `suppliers` table.

4. Created a migration script to transfer existing supplier names to the new table structure.

## Backend Services

Created a new `supplier-service.ts` file with the following functions:

1. `fetchSuppliers()`: Retrieves all suppliers from the database
2. `addSupplier(supplier)`: Adds a new supplier to the database
3. `updateSupplier(id, updates)`: Updates an existing supplier
4. `deleteSupplier(id)`: Deletes a supplier, but only if it's not used in any purchase orders

## Frontend Changes

Updated the `CreatePurchaseOrderForm` component to:

1. Fetch suppliers from the database instead of using mock data
2. Allow adding new suppliers with proper validation
3. Allow deleting suppliers with a confirmation dialog
4. Show appropriate loading states and error messages

## User Experience

1. **Adding a Supplier**:
   - Users can type a new supplier name in the dropdown and select "Create new option"
   - The new supplier is immediately saved to the database and selected in the form
   - A success message is shown when the supplier is added

2. **Deleting a Supplier**:
   - A delete button appears when a supplier is selected
   - Clicking the button shows a confirmation dialog
   - If the supplier is used in any purchase orders, deletion is prevented with an error message
   - If deletion is successful, the supplier is removed from the dropdown and a success message is shown

## Database Types

Updated the Supabase type definitions in `src/types/supabase.ts` to include the suppliers table and the new supplier_id field in purchase_orders.

## SQL Scripts

1. `create_suppliers_table.sql`: Creates the suppliers table and sets up RLS policies
2. `supplier_migration.sql`: Migrates existing supplier names to the new table structure

## Future Improvements

1. Create a separate suppliers management page for admins
2. Add more details for suppliers (addresses, contacts, etc.)
3. Implement supplier categorization
4. Add supplier search functionality for large datasets
