- [ ] Confirm background jobs are processing

### First 2 Hours
- [ ] Review user feedback/support tickets
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics trends
- [ ] Check search functionality
- [ ] Verify estimate calculations working correctly
- [ ] Test library item management features

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Review full system performance
- [ ] Check backup job execution
- [ ] Monitor user engagement metrics
- [ ] Review security logs for anomalies
- [ ] Assess overall system stability

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback Triggers

- [ ] Database connectivity issues
- [ ] Security vulnerability detected
- [ ] Critical feature completely broken

### Rollback Steps
1. [ ] Stop current deployment
2. [ ] Revert to previous Vercel deployment
3. [ ] Rollback database migrations (if needed)
4. [ ] Clear CDN cache
5. [ ] Notify team of rollback
6. [ ] Investigate issue in parallel

## Team Communication
